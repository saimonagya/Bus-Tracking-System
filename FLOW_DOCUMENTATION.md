# City Runner Flow Documentation

## Overview

City Runner is now a multi-role bus tracking system with three user experiences:

- `User`: sees live buses on the Gangtok → Ranipool route, live seat availability, ETA, and the real Sikkim route map.
- `Driver`: logs in on their phone, grants browser GPS permission, updates the assigned bus location from that phone, and manages seats for that bus.
- `Admin`: logs in with a bootstrap admin account, creates buses, provisions driver accounts, resets driver passwords, and monitors all live buses.

## Core Architecture

### Frontend

- `Next.js App Router`
- `Tailwind CSS`
- `OpenLayers`
- `OpenStreetMap tiles`
- Main UI shell: [components/city-runner-shell.tsx](/c:/Users/saiim/OneDrive/Desktop/City_Runner/components/city-runner-shell.tsx)
- Shared map: [components/route-map.tsx](/c:/Users/saiim/OneDrive/Desktop/City_Runner/components/route-map.tsx)

### Current frontend layout

The UI no longer uses a full-page map background.

The current structure is:

1. sticky header with `User / Driver / Admin`
2. top summary cards
3. embedded live map card inside the content area
4. lower operational cards like stops, fares, seats, and admin or driver controls

This embedded map card was added so the map behaves like a literal app module in the flow of the page rather than a decorative full-screen backdrop.

### Backend

- `FastAPI`
- `SQLite`
- `SQLAlchemy`
- Database setup: [backend/bus_tracker/db.py](/c:/Users/saiim/OneDrive/Desktop/City_Runner/backend/bus_tracker/db.py)
- ORM entities: [backend/bus_tracker/entities.py](/c:/Users/saiim/OneDrive/Desktop/City_Runner/backend/bus_tracker/entities.py)
- API schemas: [backend/bus_tracker/models.py](/c:/Users/saiim/OneDrive/Desktop/City_Runner/backend/bus_tracker/models.py)
- Auth helpers: [backend/bus_tracker/security.py](/c:/Users/saiim/OneDrive/Desktop/City_Runner/backend/bus_tracker/security.py)
- Route and seat templates: [backend/bus_tracker/state.py](/c:/Users/saiim/OneDrive/Desktop/City_Runner/backend/bus_tracker/state.py)
- Main API: [backend/main.py](/c:/Users/saiim/OneDrive/Desktop/City_Runner/backend/main.py)

## Authentication Flow

### Admin bootstrap

Admin credentials are not hardcoded in the source.

On backend startup:

1. The app checks whether any admin user exists.
2. If no admin exists, it reads:
   - `CITY_RUNNER_ADMIN_USERNAME`
   - `CITY_RUNNER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   - `CITY_RUNNER_ADMIN_NAME` optional
3. If `CITY_RUNNER_ADMIN_USERNAME` or `CITY_RUNNER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is missing and no admin exists yet, backend startup fails with a clear setup error.
4. The backend creates the first admin account and stores only a salted password hash.

### Password storage

Passwords are not stored in plain text.

The app uses:

- `PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256`
- random per-user salt
- stored fields:
  - `password_hash`
  - `password_salt`

This is password hashing, not reversible encryption. That is the correct pattern for user passwords. Full database-at-rest encryption would be added separately at infrastructure level in a production deployment.

### Session flow

1. Driver or admin logs in using `/api/auth/login`.
2. Backend verifies the hashed password.
3. Backend creates a random session token.
4. Only the token hash is stored in `auth_sessions`.
5. Frontend stores the plain token in `sessionStorage`.
6. Future protected calls send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
7. Driver or admin logs out using `/api/auth/logout`.
8. Backend hashes the presented bearer token, deletes the matching `auth_sessions` row, and the frontend clears the local `sessionStorage` token.

## GPS / Live Location Flow

### Driver phone as bus tracker

This is the main live tracking flow:

1. Driver opens the website on their phone.
2. Driver logs into the `Driver` view.
3. Browser asks for GPS permission.
4. Frontend starts `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(...)`.
5. Each accepted position is sent to `/api/driver/location`.
6. Backend updates the assigned bus:
   - `last_lat`
   - `last_lng`
   - `last_accuracy_meters`
   - `location_updated_at`
7. User and admin views poll the backend and render that updated location on the same Sikkim route map.

### What users see

Users do not generate the bus location.

Users only:

- view live bus positions
- optionally share their own location locally for distance-to-bus calculations
- see ETA and stop progress based on the driver-fed live coordinates
- see the same live bus location on the embedded inline map card inside the UI

### Embedded map card behavior

The inline map card is shared across:

- `User` view
- `Driver` view
- `Admin` view

It uses the same backend bus state and shows:

- live bus marker positions
- route polyline
- stop markers
- optional viewer location marker

The driver remains the source of truth for the bus GPS. User and admin are read-only viewers of that same live location data.

## Bus Management Flow

### Add a bus

Admin creates a bus with:

- bus name
- registration number
- route name

When a bus is created, the backend automatically seeds:

- the Gangtok → Ranipool stop list
- the full 17-seat template
- the Sikkim route polyline used on the map

### Create a driver

Admin creates a driver with:

- display name
- username
- initial password
- optional bus assignment

The initial password is hashed before storage.

The new driver account is marked:

- `must_change_password = true`

That flag shows up in the driver UI and admin UI.

### Reset a driver password

Admin can reset a driver password from the admin panel.

After reset:

- the new password is hashed
- `must_change_password` is set to `true` again

## Seat Management Flow

### User

- can see seat map
- cannot change seats

### Driver

- can toggle seats for the assigned bus only
- can reset all seats for the assigned bus
- can toggle active/inactive status for the assigned bus

Seat data is stored per bus in the `seats` table.

## Route / ETA Logic

The route geometry is stored as a real Sikkim polyline for the Gangtok → Ranipool corridor.

Stops currently include:

1. Gangtok
2. Tadong
3. 6th Mile
4. Boomtar
5. Singtam Turn
6. Ranipool

ETA is currently estimated by:

1. calculating distance from the live bus coordinate to the final stop
2. applying a demo average road speed

Current stop is estimated by nearest configured stop.

## Frontend Loading And Rendering Flow

### Initial page load

To avoid flashing empty fallback content, the frontend now uses an explicit loading shell.

The load sequence is:

1. page shell renders
2. client hydration completes
3. frontend requests `/api/public/buses`
4. skeleton placeholders remain visible while data is loading
5. summary cards and the embedded map render once the first public bus payload is available

This was added specifically to prevent the UI from briefly showing `No buses found` before hydration and the first successful API response.

### Map rendering strategy

The map component still loads client-side only because OpenLayers depends on browser globals.

That means:

- the shell is rendered first
- the map card shows a loading area initially
- the OpenLayers map mounts after client-side rendering is ready

## Database Tables

### `buses`

- base bus identity
- route name
- route polyline
- active/inactive state
- last live GPS fields

### `bus_stops`

- stop name
- coordinates
- fare
- order along the route

### `seats`

- one row per physical seat
- seat code
- row/column position
- booked/free state

### `users`

- admin and driver accounts
- hashed password + salt
- role
- assigned bus
- must-change-password flag

### `auth_sessions`

- hashed session token
- linked user
- expiry

## Main API Endpoints

### Public

- `GET /api/public/buses`

### Shared auth

- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`
- `GET /api/auth/me`
- `POST /api/auth/change-password`

### Driver

- `GET /api/driver/dashboard`
- `POST /api/driver/location`
- `POST /api/driver/seats/{seat_id}/toggle`
- `POST /api/driver/seats/reset`
- `POST /api/driver/bus/toggle-active`

### Admin

- `GET /api/admin/overview`
- `POST /api/admin/buses`
- `POST /api/admin/drivers`
- `POST /api/admin/drivers/{driver_id}/reset-password`

## Debugging Checklist

### Driver can log in but location does not update

Check:

- driver account has an assigned bus
- phone browser GPS permission is allowed
- backend is reachable from the phone
- `/api/driver/location` is returning success
- `location_updated_at` changes in the database

### Admin login does not work

Check:

- backend was started with `CITY_RUNNER_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `CITY_RUNNER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- the database did not already contain an admin with different credentials

### Bus does not appear live for users

Check:

- driver is logged in
- driver phone is sending GPS updates
- bus `last_lat` and `last_lng` are populated
- `location_updated_at` is recent enough to count as live

### Seats do not update in UI

Check:

- driver is assigned to that bus
- seat toggle endpoint succeeds
- frontend refreshes the public and driver/admin data after mutation

### Frontend looks broken or stale in dev

Check:

- frontend dev server is actually running on `http://localhost:3000`
- backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`
- browser cache is cleared with a hard refresh
- the `.next` cache is not corrupted

If the Next.js dev server starts returning a 500 with webpack or module-runtime errors, fix it with:

```powershell
Get-Process node | Stop-Process -Force
if (Test-Path .next) { Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next }
npm run dev
```

### Page shows loading placeholders for too long

Check:

- `GET /api/public/buses` returns data from the backend
- browser console does not show fetch failures
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` points to the running backend
- the backend database already contains the seeded default bus

## Current Scope and Honest Limitations

- The system is now multi-bus and multi-role.
- Passwords are securely hashed and salted.
- Logout now revokes the active backend session instead of only clearing browser storage.
- The database is SQLite for local/demo scale.
- The route template is currently focused on Gangtok → Ranipool.
- Full production-grade database encryption at rest is not implemented inside SQLite itself.
- There is no websocket layer yet; views refresh by polling.
- The embedded map is OpenLayers-based, uses OpenStreetMap tiles, and is styled as an inline app module. It is not Google Maps.
- The app currently depends on polling plus client hydration rather than server-streamed live state.

## Suggested Next Scaling Steps

1. Move from polling to websockets for live location and seat events.
2. Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL.
3. Add route management so admin can define different stop sets and polylines.
4. Add audit logs for admin actions.
5. Add richer session/device management for viewing and revoking other active sessions.
